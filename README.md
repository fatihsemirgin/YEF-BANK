# YEF BANKING SYSTEM
### Our project is a small bank that is looking to improve their online presence by developing a new website. The website should allow customers to access their account information, make payments and transfers, and find information about the bank's products and services. Additionally, the website should provide a secure login for customers to access their accounts and perform financial transactions.
